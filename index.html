        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha kingdom of India. The kingdom's security was entirely based on religious tolerance and the functional integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus. Shivaji Maharaj who was the descendant of a line of prominent nobles was very brave and fought many wars to consolidate India. At that time, India was under the Muslim rulers and divided. The Mughals were in north India and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur  as well as of Golconda in the south of India. The ancestral estates of Shivaji Maharaj were situated in the Deccan region in the realm of Bijapur sultans. He found the suppression of the Muslim rulers and the persecution of all the Hindus in the region. He was sad due to the devastating condition of the Hindus that by the age of 16 he convinced himself to be the cause of the Hindu's freedom. It was a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his whole life.
